# senor-trump
Android project to test some techniques of working with overlays in Kotlin

This app was made in Kotlin in some free hours of a Weekend.
It consists of a lib that provides a UI component to take pictures with Overlays over it.
The relation with Donald Trump is just for fun (I hope I will not be arrested because of that).
I tried to use the minimum of dependencies on this project.
There are many adjustments to be done, but this is a minimal functional version of this app.
